Feedback Directory
==================

This directory contains files with feedback from me. Please do not
modify or change files in this directory.


If the file "MISSING_par_sumsq" file is present, that means your
github is missing a "par_sumsq.c" file. Follow the project
instructions, you are supposed to make a copy of the serial version
("sumsq.c"), call the new copy "par_sumsq.c", and work on that
version.


The file "all-tests.output.txt" shows the output of the last time that
*I* ran test suite


Final Grade Comments
====================

The 'grade.txt' file contains your final grade on the project (out of
220). There may be individualized comments in it, but for the most
part it will be a result of the following:

* Below the grade, individualized comments will be in (parens)

* Further down you'll see the output i got running your solution.

* If the test file cannot run at all, you have a big risk of zero. If
  it looks to me like you've made a concerted effort, you should see
  between 60 and 140 points.

* Your github repository should contain a history showing how you've
  worked on the project. If you just dropped a fully working version
  into github out of nowhere, then that's a big risk of zero

* If your par_sumsq.c file is not stand-alone, then that's likely to
  be graded as "does not compile". Instructions were clearly to keep
  par_sumsq.c self-contained.

* If the 'user' time is not close to zero for all cases, deduction.

* Correct execution results are important, if the "fingerprint" isn't
  correct, it means you're not locking etc correctly.

* Compilation should be clean. You shouldn't have warning.

* Check the test timing output; if it doesn't follow the correct
  expected ('real') time, it'll be deductions.

* I think many of you missed to test with virtualbox and number of
  cores more than 1 ... so you won't actually catch lots of issues
  (like actual data races!)
